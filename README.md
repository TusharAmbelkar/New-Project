# New-Project
The lone Repository for all crazy and/or new ideas that come up.

So time again, we as programmers have the tendency of thinking up an idea - brand new or existing; which we might think is worth creating. 
So this repo is created with the sole intention of documenting the ideas (which I get or find interesting) in readMe while they are in the infancy stage, research and find resources if required, and create a rough Proof-of-concept.
If the idea is worth creating a seperate Repository for further collaboration and/or maintenance, then it will be along with the corresponding ReadMe section.

## Some rules for updating this ReadMe: 

(Will be updated once I've finalized and created a version 1.0)
